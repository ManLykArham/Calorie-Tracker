# 🍎 Calorie Counter Web App

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

After completing several projects focused on front-end development, I wanted to take things further by integrating a **database** into my work. The motivation behind this project was to create a full-stack web app where users could **track their calorie intake and expenditure**, and store this data in a database for long-term tracking.

This project was my first time hooking up a backend database with **PHP and MySQL**. The app uses the **API Ninjas API** to calculate how many calories a user has gained (from food) or lost (from exercise). It factors in important details like the weight of the food, duration of exercise, and the user's body weight to provide accurate calorie tracking.

## 🎯 Achievements

Building this project was a major step for me, as it was my **first full-stack web application** where I managed both front-end and back-end operations. I learned how to:
- Work with **PHP** to handle backend logic and interact with a **MySQL database**.
- Send and retrieve data from the database, making this my first project with persistent data storage.
- Integrate **API requests** into a full-scale application, which really helped me solidify my programming skills.
- Build a seamless user interface while managing a complex backend.

What really excited me was seeing how everything came together from creating a functional user interface to connecting it with a backend that retrieves, stores, and processes data. It also opened my eyes to the importance of **API integration** and how external services can enhance an app's functionality.

## 🏆 Overall

Creating the **Calorie Counter** app was a fantastic learning experience that not only enhanced my programming skills but also taught me how to integrate a database to make applications more dynamic. This project gave me confidence in building robust, scalable full-stack web applications that provide meaningful functionality. As I continue to work on this project, I plan to **improve the design** and explore integrating **AI features** to further enhance the user experience.
